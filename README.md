# 👋 Hi, I'm Yash Sadhukhan

🎮 **Unity & C# Gameplay Programmer | Multiplayer | Best Code Practices (SOLID and Design Patterns) | VR | DOTS | Linear Algebra | Shader Enthusiast |**

I’m a curious builder at heart — with a deep love for mathematics, physics, and computer science. What excites me most is using simulation and visualization to make sense of complex systems — whether that’s the universe itself or a fun little VR project. 🎮✨
My journey has been shaped by a mix of passions — from gaming and streaming to astrophysics and music — and all of them find their way into how I think and create.

## 🧠 Core Expertise
- 🧩 **Gameplay Programming** — Scalable mechanics, AI state machines, event systems  
- 🌐 **Multiplayer Systems** — Unity Netcode, Relay, Lobby, Authentication  
- ⚙️ **Performance Engineering** — DOTS, Burst, Jobs, Object Pooling, Profiling  
- 🎨 **Graphics & Shaders** — Shader Graph, HLSL, URP Effects 
- 🧱 **Architecture & Patterns** — SOLID Principles, Factory, Strategy, Observer, MVC, Dependency Injection, Decorator etc.
- 🧮 **Mathematics for Games** — Linear algebra, vector transformations, physics optimization


## 🚀 Highlight Projects
| Project | Description | Tech |
|----------|--------------|------|
| 🪐 **Cosmic Shore (Froglet Games)** | A large-scale space simulation featuring DOTS entities, multiplayer, and refraction shaders. | DOTS, Netcode, Shader Graph, UniTask |
| 🤝 **Rangers (Personal Project)** | Multiplayer arena prototype built with Unity Relay + Lobby + NGO | Netcode, UGS, Async Programming |
| 🧠 **Educational VR Simulations** | Real-world simulations in VR (driving, welding, bow-fishing, chemistry experiments) | VR SDKs, BNG Framework, Obi, Meta SDK |


## 🧩 Current Learning Path
- Data-Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS/ECS)
- Advanced Shader Programming (HLSL)
- Unity Multiplayer & Matchmaking Systems
- Engine Architecture and Design Patterns


## 🌍 Vision

- I aim to build systems that blend **creativity, performance, and engineering elegance** — whether it’s for **Froglet’s next-gen titles** or future collaborations with global studios like **Metacore** or **Urban Games**.


🌟 What I’m Looking For

- I’m drawn to teams that thrive at the intersection of innovation, creativity, and technical excellence. My ideal environment is one where:
  - Clean code and design patterns are the norm 🧹
  - Robust architectures are valued 🏗️
  - People push boundaries and keep learning 🚀
- Whether it’s ed-tech or large-scale game development, I want to build systems that are not only fun to play with, but meaningful.
